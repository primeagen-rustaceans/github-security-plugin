Since everybody is talking about github vulnerability where private and deleted repos are always accessible.
I am adding encryption/decryption into git workflow.


Roadmap - 
Adding the executable as a git hook to run always before pushing and after fetching.
Adding homomorphic encryption, so as the git tracking starts working. Farfetched idea, but wouldn't hurt to try it out.
